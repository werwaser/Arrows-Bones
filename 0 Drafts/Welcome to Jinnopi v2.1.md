[[0 A Bumpy Drive]]
[[1 Tense Introductions]]

Tristan lurches in his seat. The truck flies over gravel and stones out to who-knows-where, and the his seatbelt scratches against his bare skin again. Hoping that this time it will help, he tugs on his sleeveless hoodie to cover his shoulder. A few bumps later and it was back to scratching him. He cringes and repositions himself on the seat. That was giving him issues too; the seat was nothing more than a metal bench stuck to the side of the truck hull with the thinnest foam cushion on top. On the plane from Germany, he had been told by a GISTR officer to wear something suitable for exercise, so he wore his favourite running shorts. The cushion has a plastic cover which sticks to his bare thighs where the shorts don't cover them, which is pretty much all of them. Every time he moved his leg, the skin would drag against it. Instead he had to lift his legs to reposition, which meant experiencing the horrible sensation of sweaty peeling from hot plastic. If he had known he'd be put in the back of a gun-metal grey truck with no air conditioning, he would have just worn pants. He could put up with running in jeans and a jersey if it meant avoiding this sensory nightmare!

Across from Tristan, buckled into the opposite bench, is one of the officers. She had joined him and his other escorts once the second flight had landed. She had kept him in her sight ever since he climbed in the back of the tank-like truck, even once he was strapped in. She has had a strange wariness about him which, now that he thinks about it, most of the officers had. This woman in particular, however, squirms in her seat like she wishes she could be anywhere but here with him. At the airport, she was dressed similarly to all the other GISTR officers - grey business wear with a tie depicting a planet-like shape inside a shield, and the acronym GISTR below it. Now, after a while in the truck, she has removed her blazer and greatly loosened her tie. Maybe it's the heat that is making her so uncomfortable. She keeps tugging the back of her shirt, unsticking it from herself. Sweat shone along her hairline where it was yanked back into a clip. On second thought, maybe the seatbelt and sticky seat weren't so bad.

Tristan looks to his left at the front of the vehicle. The driver and passenger seat are separated by a metal partition with a narrow window at the top. It is high enough that Tristan, who was decently tall, can only see the road through the front windscreen if he lifts his whole body off his seat (which means awful peeling so, no thank you). It is an unusually summery day for September. The truck is driving towards the sun, which had risen just high enough to not be blinding Tristan. It was dawn when he got in the truck, so they had been travelling for an hour or two. Maybe. Tristan had never been good at telling the time. He hasn't had access to his phone since Germany, when they took all his luggage away. On the plane, it had taken twenty times for him to realise that the officers were audibly sighing when he asked for the hour. Tristan hasn't asked for the time since.

Out the front windscreen, a wall rises into view. The truck veers to follow it on their left. Between concrete pillars are metal panels topped with outward facing spikes. *Whatever.* Tristan thought. *I don't care if they're taking me to a spooky high security prison. Anything is better than in here.*

It isn't long before the truck makes a sharp turn and stops. The officer in the back with Tristan wriggles into her blazer, and remembers to straighten her tie right as the heavy door to his right unlocks and opens. One of the officers from the cab motion him out, which he graciously obliges. Without any breeze, the air is still warm, but it is miles better than inside the truck. He takes in the view as he stretches his clammy body, and rubs down his skin to forget the memory of scratching and sticking. Surrounding him are peculiar hills that, from close up, look like grassy dunes with one sloped side and one steep. But all of them together look like ripples in the land, emanating from the East. Even the lonely trees dotted about grow at a slant away from the sunrise. The gravel road continues along the wall in that direction, but also turns to a large gate where the truck is parked.

An officer comes up to Tristan. "They're all waiting for you in there," he says, and gestures to the gate. It is made of the same dark metal as the rest of the wall, and is open just enough to walk through. 

"Oh, thank you," Tristan says, "I'm looking forward to meeting everyone." But the officer was already walking back to the front of the truck. Tristan turns to the other officer. "Thank you for the drive," he begins, but the officer gives him nothing more then a thumbs up and a tight lipped smile as he joins the woman in the back. The doors slam shut, and the truck crunches along the road as it picks up speed and barrels over the the hills back where they came. Left alone in a cloud of dust, Tristan gives a single wave and turns on his heel towards the door. "You're welcome. No problem. Happy to," Tristan replies to himself. He sighs. *Let's hope the people waiting for me are friendlier,* he thinks, and he picks his head up and strides through the gate.

Past the gate are a row of buildings facing away from the wall. Opposite the buildings are rows upon rows of wooden platforms, metal beams, ropes, nets, tunnels - obstacle courses, Tristan figures. To his right are the people waiting for him. Standing in front of the obstacle courses is a man and a woman.

"Mr Glacier, welcome," the woman says. Her voice is precise, and very French. Matching her tone, she stands with an exact posture, clipboard firmly held at the hip. Her grey pants and blouse include purple accents, and her black hair is pulled into a black bun without a single hair out of place. "Please find your place with the other cadets." She gestures to the end of a line of three people facing her, all who look roughly Tristan's age.

The first person in line catches his eye as he passes. They give him a glance up and down, then a sly smirk. *Oh, god,* Tristan thinks as blush immediately creeps onto his face. They wear all black, with silver chains, studs and piercings all over. The only colour is their brightly dyed hair, which is mostly purple, and bright red in the front. Their arms are crossed and their hips cock to one side. The lift their head to eye him up in a way that seems like they're looking down, despite being significantly shorter than Tristan. It also catches the light across their sharp cheekbones and jawline like a cut topaz; perfect facets of a rich warm brown hue. Across their face is more black in the form of edgy makeup that mimics the swirling they're stirring in Tristan's heart. *Or more accurately, dick- Not the time, Tristan!* Tristan cut off his train of thought and tore his eyes away.

He moves along the line and says, "Hey, it's nice to meet you all, I'm-"

"Cadet!" The man beside the French woman barks so forcefully it makes Tristan jump. "You'll get your time for yakking later. You're already late and I'm tired of standing around." He stands as if he were a wall, with wide shoulders and feet planted far apart. He is wearing aviator sunglasses, but Tristan can feel the glare through them.

"Oh, sorry. I-"

"Sorry, *sir*."

"Sorry, sir... I'll... okay." He resigns to stepping back into his position at the end of the line.

As soon as Tristan has stepped back, the woman launches into a spiel. "Welcome, cadets, to Jinnopi, base of operations for Generation Power. I am Director 24A, Marguerite Cousteau. Please refer to me as Director. I understand you want to be introduced to each other," she pauses to nod to Tristan, "so we can take a moment to do that."

Confused but eager, Tristan turns to the guy next to him.

"Cadet 24A1 Lilac, Erin Xilotl-" the Director begins.

*Ah, not that kind of introductions.*

The Director is cut off by the hot punk at the other end of the line. "Sup," they say with a low crackly voice, "They/Them, ACAB, DTF-"

"Not what she meant, cadet..." the man growls. "That's your second warning." Erin simply grins, licking their teeth in a way that shouldn't be affecting tristan this much!

"Sorry, *sir*," they snide.

The Director continues, "As I was saying... Erin Xilotl of Australia; Cadet 24A2 Lilac, Kalyani Salem of England; Cadet 24A3 Lilac, Maxwell Imez of the Philippines; and Cadet 24A4 Lilac, Tristan Glacier of Germany."

Tristan peeks down the line at the others. Kalyani must be the statuesque woman beside Erin, with a perfect long nose, perfect wavy black hair, perfect needle-sharp eyeliner, he could keep going. 

The guy between him and Kalyani, therefore, is Maxwell. *God, why is everyone here hot?* Tristan thinks. Maxwell has tan skin and dark hair with a scruffy undercut. His lean with his hands in his pockets oozes cool, but Tristan notices a tenseness. From the side, Tristan can't help but notice the cute way his lower lip pouts and his eyelids droop low. Maxwell glances in his direction and he's immediately caught in his gaze. His dark, deep-set eyes draw him in. He wants to be closer, close enough to- *Fuck, no. Stop that.* Tristan forces himself to tune back into the Director's speech.

"You have all been conscripted into Generation Power," she states, "because the Global Institute of Supernatural Threat Reduction detected potentially dangerous levels of aura within you all. Our goal here at Jinnopi is to train you to release that aura in a safe and productive manner, so that you may rejoin society without posing a threat to your community or yourself."

"Taking your time with the speech there, Director," the man beside her mutters.

"I- This is what..." she stumbles, breaking the poised image for just a moment. She glances off to the side, where Tristan only now realise a person has been watching from. He is wearing a dark grey suit and sunglasses, and has a lean figure. He stands perfectly still with his hands behind his back and shoulders relaxed. "This is the normal script," the Director says, half to her companion, and half to this mysterious figure. The only responce he returns is a slow cock of his head to the side. The Director clears her throat. 

She goes to speak again, then pauses, looks down at her clipboard, then tucks it to her side again. "Aura is taxing on the body," she starts again, back to her professional cadence, "and your training will include lots of physical activity. Captain of the Grounds, Rauf Saidi, will lead you through the Entry Assessment." She gestures to the man next to her. His black hair and beard are both well-groomed, but his skin is sun-beaten. His uniform is all olive green and tucked in wherever it can be. All that's missing is a beret and he'd look like an army general. That explains the barking, at least.

The Driector continues. "This is an individual assessment to evaluate your current physical ability. You will be marked, but cannot fail. Before I hand over to the Captain, are there any questions?"

Kalyani raises her hand, than says in a British accent, "We were told we would be conscripted at eighteen, why was I not contacted until now? I turned nineteen five months ago." This was something Tristan was wondering too. His nineteenth birthday was four months ago, so he had assumed GISTR was no longer going to help him like they promised when he was fourteen.

"Uh..." The Director shoots the barest glance at the mystery man. "We will cover that later."

Kalyani raises her hand again, and says, "In what way would we pose a threat to our community if we didn't come here?" That question surprises Tristan. He had glossed over that when the Director had mentioned it because in his meeting years ago, the main benefit was helping himself. The officers had established his depersonalisation issues were because of his aura. Tristan wonders if he could expand on Kalyani's question.

The Director answers, "That will also be covered later. After the Entry Assessment, we-"

"Why are there sixteen courses, but only four of us," Erin butts in, "or will that be covered later too? *Sir*?" Their toothy smirk flashes over their face with the last word. *Feisty-* Tristan mentally kicks himself for his wandering thoughts.

The Director gives Erin a long, hard stare before saying directly to them, "Any. More. Questions."

Erin points at the mystery figure by the buildings. "Yeah, uh... who's that guy?"

The Director looks over at them again. She seems more nervous every time she does so, Tristan notes. The person does not answer Erin or address the Director. Instead, they say, "Begin the Entry Assessment, Captain."

"Oh actually, I had one-" Tristan begins before the person cuts him off.

"No more questions."

The Captain walks over to a large plastic tub, picks it up, and tosses it in front of the cadets. "Thank you, Supervisor!" he announces. "Now, since none of you are capable of following instructions, we have to do this here. Take off all your extra layers and trinkets and silly little chains," he pulls his glasses down to squint at Erin, "and put them in this box. You'll get them back at the end of the assessment. I don't have anything for your makeup, so you'll just have to sweat it off. Once you've done all that, get to the start of your course."

Tristan checks himself over, but he has been ready to go since before the sun rose. Trainers, short shorts, and a sleeveless hoodie. He instinctively massages his shoulder. Kalyani tosses her blazer and a couple bracelets in the tub. Beneath the blazer, she is wearing a form-fitting tank top and, are those abs? Tristan forces himself to turn towards the obstacle course to find his position. He turns back to the others just as Maxwell pulls his t-shirt back over his head. *Damn, too late.* He had been wearing a frayed flannel underneath it before. Maxwell walked over to his position on Tristan's left again and stretched his tanned arms to limber up.

Tristan does the same as he looks forward over the obstacle course. Each one is identical, with various obstacles in a straight line. He can only see some waist-high walls and beams, wooden stepping stones, and a corrugated iron tunnel before his vision is blocked by a wooden wall. Easy enough so far. Beside him, Maxwell is focusing ahead as well, brow furrowed, lips pouting. Past him, Kalyani has found her starting line, but she is not scanning the course. Instead, her eyes are squinting back against the sun where the Director has joined the Supervisor. The Director is not meeting the Supervisor's eyes as they converse.

Erin, unsurprisingly, takes the longest to get ready. Chain after chain comes off, followed by ripped fishnet sleeves, a handful of dangling earrings, and more chains. By the time they make it to the starting line, they just have a tiny top, huge pants, and chunky leather boots. How they plan to run in them, Tristan has no idea.

Once Erin has joined the others, the Captain puts a lid on the tub and kicks it to the side. It rattles from all the metal in it snaking around. "Great," he exclaims, "those'll be shipped to your quarters, let's get started."

"Hey, hold on!" Erin protests. "You said we'd get them at the end of the assessment!"

"Oh, whoops. Guess I fucking lied, oh no... What are you gonna do about it?" The two stare down each other until Erin huffs.

"Nothing..."

"Nothing, what?"

Erin purses their lips, holding back a retort, and swings around to face the course. The Captain sneers. He begins marching in front of the four cadets as he speaks. "Right. Now that the baby's had their tantrum, on my whistle, you will race across these obstacles to the end of the course. Skipping an obstacle is a penalty. Cheating an obstacle is a foul. Interfering with other cadets is a foul. You will be marked individually, so placement doesn't matter. However, speed does. The expected time to beat is three minutes. On your mark..."

The Captain stopped his march between Kalyani and Maxwell, and lifted his hand in the air. Along with it, the whistle rose to his mouth. Tristan shifted himself into a standing start position, as did the others. He took a deep breath in. Earth, wood, and sweat. Heat shone on his skin. Dirt scraped under the sole of his trainers. Only the subtle shifts of his fellow cadets can be heard. Pregnant silence. Tension in his muscles. Potential energy rearing to transform. Aching to release. He lets out his breath slowly. And the whistle screams!
