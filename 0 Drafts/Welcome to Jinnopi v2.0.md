[[1 Tense Introductions]]

Tristan walks up to the group.

**Director:** Mr Glacier, welcome. Please join the others in your place in line.

**Tristan:** Hey, it's nice to meet you all, I'm-

**Captain:** Cadet! You'll get your time for yakking later. You're already late and I'm tired of standing around.

**Tristan:** Oh, sorry. I-

**Captain:** Sorry, *sir*.

**Tristan:** Sorry, sir... I'll... okay.

Tristan joins the end of the line.

**Director:** Welcome, cadets, to Jinnopi, base of operations for Generation Power. I am Director 24A, Marguerite Cousteau. Please refer to me as Director. I understand you want to be introduced to each other, so we can take a moment to do that.

Tristan begins to turn towards Maxwell.

**Director:** Cadet 24A1 Lilac, Erin Xilotl-

**Erin:** Sup. They/Them, ACAB, DTF-

**Captain:** Not what she meant, cadet... That's your second warning.

**Erin:** Sorry, *sir*.

**Director:** As I was saying... Erin Xilotl of Australia; Cadet 24A2 Lilac, Kalyani Salem of England; Cadet 24A3 Lilac, Maxwell Imez of the Philippines; and Cadet 24A4 Lilac, Tristan Glacier of Germany.

**Director:** You have all been conscripted into Generation Power because the Global Institute of Supernatural Threat Reduction detected potentially dangerous levels of aura within you all. Our goal here at Jinnopi is to train you to release that aura in a safe and productive manner, so that you may rejoin society without posing a threat to your community or yourself.

**Captain:** Taking your time with the speech there, Director.

**Director:** I- This is what...

Director looks to Supervisor Jasper.

**Director:** This is the normal script.

Director composes herself.

**Director:** Aura is taxing on the body, and your training will include lots of physical activity. Captain of the Grounds, Rauf Saidi, will lead you through the Entry Assessment. This is an individual assessment to evaluate your current physical ability. You will be marked, but cannot fail. Before I hand over to the Captain, are there any questions?

**Kalyani:** We were told we would be conscripted at eighteen, why was I not contacted until now? I turned nineteen five months ago.

**Director:** Uh... we will cover that later.

**Kalyani:** In what way would we pose a threat to our community if we didn't come here?

**Director:** That will also be covered later. After the Entry Assessment, we-

**Erin:** Why are there sixteen courses, but only four of us, or will that be covered later too? *Sir*?

Director gives Erin a long hard stare.

**Director:** Any. More. Questions.

Erin points at Supervisor Jasper.

**Erin:** Yeah, uh... who's that guy?

**Supervisor Jasper:** Begin the Entry Assessment, Captain.

**Tristan:** Oh actually, I had one-

**Supervisor Jasper:** No more questions.

Captain grabs a plastic tub and chucks it in front of the cadets.

**Captain:** Thank you, Supervisor! Now, since none of you are capable of following instructions, we have to do this here. Take off all your extra layers and trinkets and silly little chains, and put them in this box. You'll get them back at the end of the assessment. I don't have anything for your makeup, so you'll just have to sweat it off. Once you've done all that, get to the start of your course.

The cadets remove their accessories. Erin takes the longest. Captain puts on the lid, then kicks the tub to the side.

**Captain:** Great, those'll be shipped to your quarters, let's get started.

**Erin:** Hey, hold on! You said we'd get them at the end of the assessment!

**Captain:** Oh, whoops. Guess I fucking lied, oh no... What are you gonna do about it?

Erin huffs.

**Erin:** Nothing...

**Captain:** Nothing, what?

Erin storms off to the start of their course.

**Captain:** Right, now that the baby's had their tantrum, on my whistle, you will race across these obstacles to the end of the course. Skipping an obstacle will result in penalties. Interfering with other cadets will result in penalties; you are being marked individually, not ranked. The expected time to beat is five minutes. On your mark...

Captain raises his hand and puts his whistle in his mouth. He blows it and swings his hand down, and the cadets launch off the starting mark.
