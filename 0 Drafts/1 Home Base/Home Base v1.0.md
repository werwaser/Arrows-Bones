Life isn't perfect. We all put on a brave face every day, pretending we don't struggle like everyoone else. Masks are painted with smiles that don't reach the eyes, or wicked glares that deter predators like a brightly coloured fish. But upkeeping a mask throughout the day takes tremendous energy, which is why Kalyani Salem, princess of perfection, allows herself to slump in her seat. She is in the back of an armoured truck, sitting on a cold and hard bench beside a man her age named Maxwell Imez. They are both tired. Their legs ache from use, as do their arms, their cores, and their eyes. Kalyani had been woken jetlagged before dawn, and had not been given rest until now, well after dusk. 

She rubs her eyes, ignoring how it smudges her perfect eyeliner, and she looks across the truck to the other bench. Two others she has met today sit there, Tristan and Erin. They are not slouching like she is. In fact, they are full of energy. Erin leans up to Tristan's ear, hand on his thigh, and Tristan blushes at their words. They've been like this since the presentation this morning. They had traded glances, lip bites, grazing touches; Kalyani swears she even saw Erin cup Tristan's face at one point, stroking their thumb just against the corner of his mouth. Who could resist, though. She had done almost the same thing after the Entry Assessment. 

Kalyani had caught him staring at her tits, right after she had been watching him from behind. There is no way he doesn't know what he is doing to people when he wears those tiny booty shorts. It was on pure impulse that she approached him, and it wasn't until she was centimetres away from his face that she realised what she had done. 

Kalyani's thoughts are interrupted by Maxwell nudging her elbow. "Hey," he says, "Just letting you know, you're kinda staring."

"Ah, I was spacing out." She sits up straighter, composing her mask again.

"I'm not, like, scolding you or anything," he mumbles just loud enough to hear over the truck engine. "I was kinda staring too, and it's not like they're gonna notice." They both watch for a moment. The two have twisted in their seats to be almost face to face. They take turns smirking into each other's ears, and [smth else]. Tristan has his hands strategically placed in his lap.

"True," Kalyani finally replies. "They really hit it off quick, didn't they?"

"Sure did. Did you see Tristan as he walked in? Love at first sight or something."
