Tristan lurched in his seat. The truck he was sitting in flew over gravel and rocks on a road out in who-knows-where. It didn't help that the seat was barely cushioned, and the seatbelt scratched his bare shoulder. It wasn't more than a glorified bench stuck to one wall of the tank-like vehicle. He adjusted his sleeveless hoodie yet again to try and cover where the belt contacted skin, but it only took a few seconds for the truck to hit another bump and undo all his careful positioning. His fingers drummed on his knee, then he bounced his leg, then went back to drumming. The plastic of the seat stuck to his thighs where his athletic shorts didn't cover, which unfortunately was most of his legs. The officer on the plane had told him to wear something suitable for exercise, but if he had known that he would be ushered into the back of this gun-metal grey truck with no air conditioning, he would have succumbed to running 10 miles in a button-up and jeans if he could stop this sensory nightmare.

Against the opposite wall of the back of the truck sat one of the officers. This one had joined them at the airport. She had wordlessly and... almost cautiously climbed in the back with him. Her brow was shiny with sweat, and she kept repositioning herself to unstick her shirt from her back. She wore a similar uniform to all the other officers had chaperoned him in his travels; professional work attire not suited for the summer heat all in whites and greys. Most of the officers (including the woman across from him) wore grey tires with the G.I.S.T.R. logo on them. It was a [logo description]. The woman had loosened her tie only a short while into driving as the heat slowly rose. On second thought, maybe the seatbelt and sticky seat weren't so bad.

On Tristan's left was the front of the vehicle. There was a divider between the passenger area and the driver with a window just low enough that Tristan, at a solid six feet tall, could see through the top half of the front windscreen. It was an almost cloudless morning. The sun was ahead of them and just to the right, rising high enough to not blind him as he peered over to try and see the road. The rippling scrublands the airport was in had dipped away to much flatter land an hour or two ago. Maybe. Tristan had never been good at guessing time. The officers had put his phone with his suitcases and other belongings before he had even boarded the plane in Germany, so he had asked them for the hour at least twenty times before he noticed the sigh the officer would give every time before he answered. Tristan stopped asking after that.

Out the front windscreen, something finally rose into view. The road veered right as it met a large concrete and metal fence and followed it east. Spikes lined its top, pointing outwards. *"Strange"*, Tristan thought, *"there's nothing out here. Why do they need spikes?"* He didn't ask the officer what the fence was for, or what the time was.
