[[2 Entry Assessment]]

Tristan lurched in his seat. The truck he was sitting in flew over gravel and rocks on a road out in who-knows-where. It didn't help that the seat was barely cushioned, and the seatbelt scratched his bare shoulder. It wasn't more than a glorified bench stuck to one wall of the tank-like vehicle. He adjusted his sleeveless hoodie yet again to try and cover where the belt contacted skin, but it only took a few seconds for the truck to hit another bump and undo all his careful positioning. His fingers drummed on his knee, then he bounced his leg, then went back to drumming. The plastic of the seat stuck to his thighs where his athletic shorts didn't cover, which unfortunately was most of his legs. The officer on the plane had told him to wear something suitable for exercise, but if he had known that he would be ushered into the back of this gun-metal grey truck with no air conditioning, he would have succumbed to running 10 miles in a button-up and jeans if he could stop this sensory nightmare.

Against the opposite wall of the back of the truck sat one of the officers. This one had joined them at the airport. She had wordlessly and... almost cautiously climbed in the back with him. Her brow was shiny with sweat, and she kept repositioning herself to unstick her shirt from her back. She wore a similar uniform to all the other officers had chaperoned him in his travels; professional work attire not suited for the summer heat all in whites and greys. Most of the officers (including the woman across from him) wore grey tires with the G.I.S.T.R. logo on them. It was a [logo description]. The woman had loosened her tie only a short while into driving as the heat slowly rose. On second thought, maybe the seatbelt and sticky seat weren't so bad.

On Tristan's left was the front of the vehicle. There was a divider between the passenger area and the driver with a window just low enough that Tristan, at a solid six feet tall, could see through the top half of the front windscreen. It was an almost cloudless morning. The sun was ahead of them and just to the right, rising high enough to not blind him as he peered over to try and see the road. The rippling scrublands the airport was in had dipped away to much flatter land an hour or two ago. Maybe. Tristan had never been good at guessing time. The officers had put his phone with his suitcases and other belongings before he had even boarded the plane in Germany, so he had asked them for the hour at least twenty times before he noticed the sigh the officer would give every time before he answered. Tristan stopped asking after that.

Out the front windscreen, something finally rose into view. The road veered right as it met a large concrete and metal fence and followed it east. Spikes lined its top, pointing outwards. *"Strange"*, Tristan thought, *"there's nothing out here. Why do they need spikes?"* He didn't ask the officer what the fence was for, or what the time was.

The road gave one last crackle beneath the truck's tyres as it came to a stop. Tristan could hear the officers in the front get out, but the woman across from him didn't do anything except straighten her tie. He looked to the back of the truck. Its back door was thick and heavy, covered in rivets and locked tight. After a few moments, a series of heavy clunks came from it, and an officer swung it open to let him out. He stretched as much of his body as he could as he exited the vehicle. It was so much better having room to move and nothing touching his skin, but the air was still desert hot.

The truck had parked in the middle of the road in front of a gate in the fence. One side of it was half open, and the truck driver was motioning Tristan towards it. He turned back to look at the truck, right as the doors slammed after all the officers climbed in. They drove away, continuing east along the fence, leaving Tristan with the gate. *"And whatever is on the other side of it,"* he sighed internally. 

Tristan walked up and peeked around the thick metal to see it was mostly the same plains on the other side of the fence. However, tyre tracks led up to a cluster of small buildings not too far away, and past them, he could see people standing around. Probably waiting for him. That urged him enough to cross through the gate and approach (not that he had anywhere else to go).

The first thing that caught Tristan's attention as he passed between the buildings was the rows and rows of beams, planks, walls, tyres, nets, ropes, and other wooden and metal structures. This obstacle course repeated sixteen times across, and stretched way off into the distance. This is probably why he was told to dress for exercise. A man and a woman stood in front of one of the courses, facing him and three other people lined up to his right.

The man stood with his legs wide, hands on his hips, and wore aviator sunglasses and an outfit that somehow looked athletic and formal. Within his well-groomed beard, his lips were pouted. His boot tapped the beaten dirt in a slow, bored rhythm. The woman beside him was much more alert; her back was straight, her blouse and pants were pressed, and her clipboard was tucked neatly under her arm. She had pale skin and black hair that was held in a bun without a single hair out of place. Her eyes were on him, sharp but not glaring, as she said, "Mr Glacier, glad you have finally arrived. Please join the line with your division." She spoke with a strong French accent, one that reminded Tristan of [smth idk]. The man motioned to the other end of the line with a flick of his finger, and Tristan obliged, walking past the three people who looked to all be his age.

The first one caught his eye as he passed, and gave him a glance up and down, then a sly smirk. They wore all black, and were covered in chains and piercings. Across their face was even more black in the form of dramatic makeup, but their hair was bright purple and red. Their arms were crossed and their hips cocked to one side. Despite being at least fifteen centimetres shorter than Tristan, it felt like they were looking down at him. They looked at him through their lashes with their head tilted up. Like a perfectly cut topaz, their face caught the light in sharp angles at their jawline and cheekbones, and was a rich warm brown that drew him in and made him want to- *"Not the time, Tristan! Not the time."* He quickly looked away and found his place at the end of the line.

"Now that we are all here, let's begin." The woman addressed the four of them, "My name is Marguerite Cousteau, and I am Director 24A of the Violet Corps, you may call me Director."

She turned to the man, and he introduced himself, "Greetings, cadets! I am Captain Rauf Saidi, you will refer to me as Captain or Sir. I will be running and evaluating your Entry Assessment."

The Director spoke again, "Each of you were given you identification when your arrived in Alraduning Islands, please introduce yourselves with your I.D. and name." She looked to the punk at the end of the line, who shifted their weight to the other hip.

"Uh, sup," their voice was deep and crackly, like a big cat's snarl, but its tone was light and playful. "I'm Erin-"

Director interrupted with, "I.D. first, cadet."

Erin just gave her a slow blink, then sighed and pulled out a card to read from. "Cadet 24A1 Lilac, Erin Xilotl," they said with robotic sarcasm. "They/Them, ACAB, DTF-"

They were cut off again, this time by Captain. "Cadet! You are disrespecting your superiors and will suffer consequences because of it!" Erin just gave him an impish grin. Their tongue flicked along their teeth and Tristan looked away because - again - not the time!

Director's professionalism dropped for a second, and she said, "Uhm yes, agreed. There will be... consequences." She glanced across to the side, where Tristan only now realised another person was standing. He was lean and lightly tanned, with a well fitting suit and sunglasses. The clothes were in that familiar GISTR officer grey, but looked more professional with the blazer fitting so snugly. The confidence they exuded, and the way Director glanced at them, added to the importance. This was clearly Director's boss, in some way, and she was trying very hard to impress him.

After clearing her throat, Director motioned to the next person in line. She tossed her wavy black hair to the side as she met the eyes of everyone as a hello. She was wearing sharply winged eyeliner, and had thick, shaped brows. Her medium-brown skin was velvety smooth and her nose was long and perfectly symmetrical. Another hot one. Dammit. 

"Cadet 24A2 Lilac," she said with a British accent, "Kalyani Salem, She/Her."

"Oh, you think you're so smart, don't you," Captain began, "You think you can just-"

After a few frantic glances around, most going to the mysterious man, Director cut him off to curtly say, "Pronouns are fine, Captain. That is an acceptable addition." He grumbled some more before jerking his hand at the third person in the line.

The guy looked to Tristan and his dark, deep-set eyes that drew him in - *"Fuck! No, stop that."* - gave him the slightest roll, before he sighed and turned back to the group. "I'm Cadet 24A3 Lilac, also known as Maxwell Imez." His voice was mellow and smooth, like melted chocolate. Decadent and intimate and *"Oh my god, Tristan, what is wrong with you? You've just met these people!"* 

"I use He/Him pronouns," he finished, and turned again to Tristan.

It took Tristan a moment to realise that Maxwell was waiting for him to speak next, and not just gracing him with a view of his scruffy-in-a-hot-way face. "Oh uh, hi!" he fumbled, "I'm Cadet 24A4 Lilac, and my name's Tristan Glacier, He/Him." On instinct, he added on, "It's nice to meet you all," but immediately regretted it as the Captain whipped his aviators off to glare at him.

"Alright, with introductions complete, let me welcome you all to Jinnopi, and Generation Power," Director began.

She was cut off by Erin, who said, "Hold up, what do you mean introductions are over? Who's that guy?" They jerk their thumb at the mysterious man in the suit, who just stands there.

"Um, Supervisor Jasper, would you like to introduce yourself?" Director asked them meekly.

Their only reply was, "They already know more about me than they need to, thank you Director 24." Her cheeks bloomed pink as she mumbled an apology.

Director did her best at composing herself again before continuing. "Welcome, cadets, to Jinnopi, the base of operations for Generation Power. As you and your parents are aware, you have been conscripted into this project for emitting concerningly high A.I.D. levels at a young age. Through Generation Power, we will help you contain your Aura, hone it into a Power, and survive this misfortune to become a new type of public servant."

Tristan could tell this was a scripted spiel, but he couldn't help feel encouraged by it. G.I.S.T.R. officers spoke to him and his family when he was fourteen, and explained that he would become an agent once he was a legal adult.  [backstory stuff. is it too early for flashback?]

. . .

The Director continued her speech. "Aura is taxing on the body, and the roles you may fill in your future will require physical adeptness. For these reasons, all cadets are required to complete the Entry Assessment."  She gestured to the course behind her. "Captain of the Training Grounds, Rauf Saidi, will lead you through these assault courses. I see some of you received the instruction to wear fitness wear," she paused to glare at Erin and Kalyani, "but for those who haven't, please remove any extra layers or accessories and place them in this crate. You will receive them back at the end of the day." Captain Saidi picked up and tossed a large plastic tub in front of himself. "Line up by your course once you're ready," he said, "Let's finally get moving."

The four cadets were lined up in front of their obstacle courses. The Captain stood between Kalyani and Maxwell in the centre and barked, "Skipping an obstacle is a penalty. Cheating an obstacle is a foul. Interfering with other cadets is a foul. You will be marked individually, so placement doesn't matter. However, speed does. On my whistle, you will go."

He paused, scanning over the four cadets. As he lifted the whistle to his mouth, Tristan got down in a runner's start position. He slowed his breathing, steady in and steady out, and focused his eyes on the first obstacle a few metres ahead. Silence rang loud as everyone held themselves tense, ready to burst forward on the-

The Captain blew the whistle and they launched! Shoes pounded the dirt and all four of them vaulted over the first wall in sync. They ducked under a bar. Then another vault, another bar, another vault. In rhythm, leaping and crouching. Sliding out the other side and straight onto stepping stones. One, two, three, four, five. Four pairs of feet bounding off wood platforms. Breathe in, breathe out. Tristan was fit, he kept himself cool. He dove to the ground and began crawling through the tunnel on his stomach. His breathing matched his arm over arm motion. Muffled by the corrugated metal, Tristan heard the Captain yelling. "I don't wanna see you slacking. Move it! Move it!"

Tristan exited the tunnel first, about a second before Kalyani. They sprinted to the next obstacle. Tristan slammed his hands on the top of the low wall and hoisted himself straight up. He swung his knee up and rolled onto the platform. Out of the corner of his eye, Kalyani did the same. A practiced move. "Go! Go! Go!" the Captain yelled again. Tristan kicked off and grabbed the vertical net strung between this platform and the next. Hand over hand. Foot over foot. Strafe to the right. He glanced up and locked eyes with Maxwell. He had just climbed onto the net, facing the opposite way to Tristan. He grinned. Tristan grinned back. He couldn't help himself, not when Maxwell's eyes creased like that, and the morning sun glowed on his warm tan- 

"Tristan! Keep! Moving!" The Captain's voice came from right beneath him. Shit! Maxwell was ahead of him now. He climbed across to the end of the net and jumped down the steep steps. A rope hanged from a beam four metres up. "Slap the bar to move on!" the Captain barked. Tristan's shoes skidded in the dust, and he wrapped himself around the coarse rope. Arms up, legs up. Strong, practiced movements. He slapped the metal and it rang a dull tone. He dropped down - *ah, rope burn* - and threw himself onward. Up a ramp, leap over and land on a slope, watch the ankle. Thud, thud, thud of wood. Thud, thud, thud of dirt.

"Come on Erin, Tristan is already over the ditch!" He glanced back to see everyone still climbing up the rope. The Captain jogged between Erin and Kalyani. Erin glared down at him and hoisted themselves up again. Focus, Tristan. A wooden beam rose from the ground, and Tristan balanced up it with as much speed as he could. It levelled out, then jerked right, then left. On the corner, Tristan almost fell, as the Captain bellowed, "Erin Xilotl, you are falling behind! Get your punk ass down that rope and run! Run!"

Tristan hopped down the two poles to the ground, then sprinted at the wall. He planted a foot against it, then launched up to lift himself over. Perched on top, he glanced back. Erin had just dropped to the ground, red in the face from exertion and fury. Kalyani was at the end of the balancing beam, psyching herself up for the pole jumps. Maxwell wobbled slightly on his way up the first beam. His eyes watched his feet, and his arms flailed out to his sides. Checking the Captain is occupied first, Tristan whistled and caught Maxwell's attention. He motioned *look at me* with his hands. Maxwell nodded, and kept his eyes trained on Tristan, holding a focus to balance. He made a show of slowly breathing in an then out, and Maxwell followed suit, slowing his panting. He had almost made it to the end, when the Captain hollered at Tristan to "Keep going! No breaks!" 

Kalyani was up on the wall as well, so Tristan dropped down, losing sight of Maxwell. He rolled into his landing, and sprung up to run at the square hole in the next wall. He hopped through. His strong legs were long enough to jump through easily enough. Right on his tail, Kalyani hoisted herself up into the window and kicked both her legs forward. She landed immediately in a sprint, and joined Tristan's pace as they ran up the apex ladder. As he reached the peak of the triangle of rung-like steps, he couldn't help but admire Kalyani's athleticism. It took a lot of work for him to be in this shape, and she was keeping up. Muscles flexed within her toned legs, pumping as she hurried down the steps. Back straight, breathing steady, she was experienced too. *And hot, but that's not important right now,* Tristan chastised himself.

He bounded up the ramp and saw from the top of it the finish line! He and Kalyani jumped down the terraces, one drop at a time, and broke into a full-on sprint for the finish. He could do this. Just one last stretch. One last push. One last step. One last- and he was over. He stumbled to a stop, and turned to see Kalyani doing the same only a second behind him. She threw her head back as her chest rose and fell dramatically. Sweat glistened on her skin where her tank top dropped low. Tristan glanced away from her chest, and *Oh, shit she's looking at me. Did she catch me staring? Oh, god she's gonna think I'm a creep.* Her makeup had survived the obstacle course, so when she stared him down, it was with sharp, flawless, heavy-lashed eyes. She sauntered over and got *oh, god* so close to his face. She held the moment, scanning Tristan's face with an intensity that would have made him sweat if he wasn't already. But she just smiled and said, "Nice job," and walked off to grab a water bottle.

Still on the course, the Captain was heckling Maxwell as he lowered himself down the high wall. Erin was standing away from it, taking a few breaths, before they ran at it. They launched themselves up, straining to grab the top, but their fingertips grazed the lip. Erin dropped and stepped back, their face twisted with frustration, as they backed away to try again.
