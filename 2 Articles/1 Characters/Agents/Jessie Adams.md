| Jessie Adams | She/Her  | 5B6 Orange | 26  | Scotland |
## Appearance
Jessie is thickly built and of average height, and has pale freckled skin. Her hair is curly ginger and reaches past her back even when in a ponytail (as it always is). She wears glasses and flannel.
## Personality
Jessie has a thick Scottish accent and doesn't mince words. She has a deprecating, English type of humour, but is fiercely kind. She is homophobic out of ignorance, and could easily switch to being an ally.
## Power
Jessie can freeze creatures' bodies in place. Typically she does this with just a limb, but if she exerts herself she can freeze a whole person. She is training to freeze organs to make them stop working.
