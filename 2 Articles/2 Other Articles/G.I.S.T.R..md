The Global Institution for Supernatural Threat Response (or **G.I.S.T.R.**) is an international organisation that supersedes governments in what they deem "supernatural issues". They research an energy they call [[Aura]], and prevent massive damage from the [[Events]] it causes.

## Logo
GISTR's logo has three elements. The first is a circle with blobs of solid colour, resembling the planet. Around that, is a shield shape. And finally, below the shield is the institution's initials. 

The colouring of the logo is very deliberate, but subtle enough that most people don't notice its importance. Within the organisation, the logo is entirely grey, or grey with dark blue fill on the shield. Towards the general public and in correspondence with countries, the logo is light blue, matching the United Nations logos. Very rarely, a high definition version of the logo will be used, which replaces the circle with a posterised image of Earth, and adds swirling effects being deflected by the shield.
