**Jinnopi** is the base of operations for the [[G.I.S.T.R.]] initiative [[Project EPLIUM]]. Approximately 370 agents and 260 officers live and work there.

The base is separated into the following areas:
- Amenities
- Corps Quarters
- [[Operations Centre]]
- [[Research Sector]]

Amenities include:
- Dinner Service
- [[Gymnasium]]
- Laundry
- [[Power Training Facility]]
- Various outdoor spaces (courts, gardens, paved squares, etc.)

The Research Sector is walled off and guarded, and is only accessible by passing through the Operations Centre. Amenities and Corps Quarters are partially blended because they are all used by agents.
