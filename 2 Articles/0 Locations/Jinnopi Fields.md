Surrounding the base itself, is Jinnopi Fields. This is the land used for training. It is entirely surrounded by a concrete and metal fence. The fence has outward-facing spikes to deter local fauna [[Events]] from climbing over it. 

Scattered about the fields are some permanent structures, including:
- [[Entry Assault Course]]
- [[The Simulator]]
## Geography
Jinnopi is inland on the most eastern main island of the [[Alraduning Islands]]. The area surrounding the base (Jinnopi Fields) is mostly scrubland, occasionally with bizarre rounded cliffs. [[Base Jinnopi]] itself was built atop an underground reservoir of [[Eplium]], on a hairpin cliff in a flat plain.
