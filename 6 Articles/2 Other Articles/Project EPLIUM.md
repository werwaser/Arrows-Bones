**Project: EPLIUM** is aÂ [[G.I.S.T.R.]] initiative to create Powered soldiers to combat supernatural [[Events]]. This ultra-powerful army is being created by conscripting 18 year-old people that show signs of strong [[Aura]] within them, and training them at [[Jinnopi]] to be channelled into a [[Power]].

This project is highly confidential, to the point where only a few higher-ups know its actual purpose. To anyone below them or governments prying, they are conducting **Generation Power** (also known as GenP): a GISTR initiative to develop a generation of Powered service workers (e.g. firefighters, miners, rescue teams, police, frontier explorers). To governments and businesses that fund the project, they promise access to these efficient "members of the community" once the initiative has completed its first phase.
## Aquiring Agents
Using satellite [[A.I.D. Meter|A.I.D. Meters]], GISTR records any locations with particularly high AID levels. If the source of the high AID level is a person under the age of 18, they collect their information and visit the family to inform them that their child will be conscripted into Generation Power a short time after their eighteenth birthday. Due to the [[International Supernatural Agreement]] GISTR has free reign to govern any adult individual that is provably a possible threat, hence why the agents are not conscripted until they are 18.

Individuals are chosen to become [[Agents]] by [[Directors]] When constructing their [[Division]], directors prioritise high AID levels and more combat-ready aura types, such as [aura types]. Not very many teenagers reach high enough AID levels to be recorded, so only about ten people who were informed don't get conscripted each time a new division is made.
