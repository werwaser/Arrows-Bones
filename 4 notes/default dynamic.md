The Lilacs' default dynamic is how they back each other up when in unplanned situations:

One person is the Ghost, attempting to do something unseen. Along with them as an investigator is the Pressure, another person who pushes to ask uncomfortable questions. The other two are the cover, one of them being the Empath (acting as if on the target's side) and the other as the Guide (giving explanations and excuses for everyone else).

More often than not, Kalyani is the Ghost, Erin is the Pressure, Maxwell is the Empath, and Tristan is the Guide. Erin and Kalyani are usually the investigators because of their shared suspicion, and luckily Maxwell and Tristan make good cover as charming lads.
