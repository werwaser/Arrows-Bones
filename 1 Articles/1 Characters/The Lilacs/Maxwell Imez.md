**Insecurities.**
Maxwell develops an insecurity over being inadequate from power training with other telekinetics. Before being enlisted he rarely had any issues with his skill; he was a decent student, could sing and play the guitar well, and he was cool enough to never get bullied. Being so completely behind the other agents in power who would tease him for it was a completely new experience and shook his confidence.

**Passions.**
Maxwell enjoys rock, disco, and love songs.
