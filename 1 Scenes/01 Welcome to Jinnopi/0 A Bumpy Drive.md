- Tristan is uncomfortable in the truck seat
	- He unsuccessfully tries to adjust his clothes to cover his skin
- The officer in with him is also uncomfortable in the mugginess, but also is wary of him
- Out the front window, Tristan sees the fence around Jinnopi Fields, and the landscape in general
- The truck stops and the drivers let him out. Some other officers climb in the back, and they leave him in front of a gate.
