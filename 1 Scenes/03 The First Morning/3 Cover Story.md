## Emotional Turn
**NEG -> POS**
## Beats
- While passing it, Director points out that behind the guarded wall is Authorised Personnel only and is off-limits
- At the back of the group, Erin whispers something to Kalyani
- When they have an opportunity, Erin and Kalyani slip away, leaving an illusion of Kalyani behind
	- Maxwell and Tristan notice, and share a look
	- They have a weirdly strong understanding of each other and agree to give the other two a cover story
- Director turns around and notices Erin is gone
- "Kallusion" says they needed to tie their shoe and were going to catch up
	- Director says they should have told her, Kallusion doesn't respond: Maxwell realises Kalyani can't hear them from wherever she's hiding
	- Maxwell exaggeratedly tells Kallusion to go find Erin so they can catch up
		- Kalyani catches on and has the illusion walk away
- Director decides to wait in place until they come back, 
-
