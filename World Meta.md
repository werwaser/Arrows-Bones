# Foundations
## Scope
### What is your motivation for building this world?
I want to build an alternate Earth to set a superpowered mystery novel in.
### What are you hoping to get out of it?
I'm hoping to write a 100k+ novel with a target audience of 20-30 year olds  who are unsatisfied by society's structure.
### What is the Hook or Unique Selling Point of your world? What makes it unique or different?
The world has a unique type of energy that, when released causes supernatural things to happen. This has shifted the course of history slightly, making the world recognisable to readers, but still containing surprises and mysteries.
## Theme
### What’s the Genre of your World?
The world is set a few decades in the future, making it semi sci-fi, with wild supernatural elements.
### How does the world feel (audience experience)?
The world feels unbalanced and secretive, always on the edge of releasing something dangerous or mysterious.
### What is the tone of your world?
Like the real world, the tone is a mix of dark and bright; the world itself is wondrous and fascinating, but corruption runs deep in the governments.
### What is the character agency level like?
The main characters don't have much agency on the world at large, it takes continued effort to make lasting effects to anything beyond their control.
### What are the recurring themes which reinforce the genre, tone and feel of your world?
1. A glance to their superior mid-sentence.
2. Beautiful things are the most dangerous.
3. Acceptance being used for exploitation.
## Meta:
**Supernatural Influence.** The presence of aura in Earth has altered the course of history, making it ever so slightly more fantastical. Supernatural events are also becoming harder to predict and contain in the current day.
**Government Presence.** The only defence against supernatural disaster is an international organisation that works above any national governments. They are, however, funded by countries, and so there is a constant power struggle between them.
**Social Services.** []

# Setting the Scene
## Rules of the World
### What are the fundamental differences in the natural laws of your world compared to Earth?
There is an energy called Aura that can cause supernatural events to happen. This was a small factor of the world until roughly around the turn of the era, when Titans where brought into the world and increased the aura exponentially. They are no longer here, but left plenty of aura stored within all parts of the world.
## Geography
### What does the geography of your world look like?
The Alraduning Islands have a similar climate to Australia: the North is warm all year round, and is mostly desert or sub-tropical; whereas the South has four seasons and consists of scrublands and plains. All across the islands are unnatural - warped, even - landscapes including rippling land, coasts with deep gashes, and hills that curl so far they shouldn't be able to stay up. 
### Does your Geography have any special properties or features?
The huge amount of aura in the Alraduning Islands gives the land, plants, animals, and indigenous people vast amounts of supernatural power.
## Initial size of building
### What is the initial size of your active story setting?
I will only be describing the Alraduning Islands and G.I.S.T.R. in great detail for this story. I may touch on other parts of the world if relevant, but only lightly.
## People and their History
### Who used to live in your active story space, and what’s their history?
Many aboriginal groups, collectively known as Alraduning Tribes, lived along the western coast of Australia before it was broken off into the Alraduning Islands by the departing Titans. Many of them were wiped out in that time, but a handful of those tribes survived and have developed well, having been untouched by colonisation and powered by aura.

One notable group was the Jawilgu. They were the ones who summoned Titans as gods. The Titans did not appreciate being pulled from their home plane, so they destroyed the Jawilgu city and themselves in such a huge release of aura that it split the Alruduning Islands off Australia. Remains of the city are scattered about the south-eastern islands.
### Which species/cultures live here now and what’s their history?
G.I.S.T.R. has set up multiple bases at prime locations on the islands. This is so they can study and harness aura, and also so they have permanent settlements outside of governmental jurisdiction.

A handful of aboriginal groups still thrive in the islands' harsh and wild environment. All their technology and culture is aura-based, and they can come across as alien to outsiders.
### What do they need, and what do they need from each other?
G.I.S.T.R. highly values Alraduning Islands, as it is a good example of what to expect from rampant aura. There is some effort to respect the indigenous people's ownership of the land (though frankly not enough), and they are welcomed into the organisation for their expertise on aura.

The Alraduning Tribes do not need anything from G.I.S.T.R., but they see how valuable settling on the islands is to the organisation, so agreements have been made to let them stay for egregious trades.
