# Summary
## Hook
Four 19 year olds join Generation Power as the smallest and weakest division. They immediately bond with each other, and become suspicious of GISTR's motives.
## Main Plot
The Lilacs investigate what is truly going on with Generation Power, doing their best to avoid revealing their intentions. They agree to doing GISTR's morally-grey missions as an excuse to snoop.
## Climax
Their deception works too well and not well enough, and Kalyani is brought in to test her power, which she has been keeping secret. They take it as an opportunity to infiltrate the Operations Centre and discover Project: EPLIUM.
## Resolution
As soon as Kalyani is released from Operations Centre, the Lilacs go to inform Director what they learned, but an officer but them and they are sent on holiday while Director goes to an annual conference. During that week, it is discovered that Director's espionage corps will be expanded without her permission.
