# Arrows & Bones
Welcome to the Arrows & Bones repository! This is where I will share anything I write for the Arrows & Bones story ~~because World Anvil uses BBCode and god it's such a pain to work with.~~ I am using [Obsidian.md](https://Obsidian.md) to write this, so if you download this repository and open it with Obsidian, you can use the links and view it in colour!

Less structured thoughts can also be found at [this Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/foUTAWp2rr9T3IsSzqIMgz/A%26B-Train-of-Thought).

You're welcome to use the Discussion page on GitHub to make suggestions, ask questions, point out errors, or just talk about the story.
